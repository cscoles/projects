				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who has access to my information?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Any information that you provide through the registration portal will be visable only to yourself. The only way to access your information will be with the username and password that you create when you register for an account. For this reason it is imperative that you protect your login information, and if you think someone may have acquired your login info, it is strongly suggested that you update your password. Outside of your own account, the only other access to your information will be the access granted to the PSR Administration, who will have access to the information as needed to run the program.</p>

Additionally, all data entered and stored through the app is kept on secure data servers that are constantly updated, and meet all security regulations to ensure your data is kept safe.</p>
